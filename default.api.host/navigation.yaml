# appear in your portal's navigation. If a page or folder name is not included,
# then it will not appear in your portal.
#
# 'Introduction', 'API Reference', and 'Resources' are special sections,
# and will always appear in your portal.
#
# If you add a folder to 'ordering', be sure to add a corresponding entry
# in the 'folders' map below.

    # If you want to have sub-folders, you can add another 'folders' map within
    # this folder's configuration.
    # In this example, there is only a 'Getting Started' page and no sub-folders.
    # The add_example_page script will add a page named 'Example Page' here.
